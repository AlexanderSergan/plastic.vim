# candid.vim
A dark vim/neovim color scheme ~~shamely copied~~ inspired in [VSCode theme Plastic](https://github.com/will-stone/plastic) and [Onedark.vim](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)

### Install

Copy `colors/candid.vim` in your `[vim/neovim]/colors` directory.

```vim
syntax on
colorscheme candid
```

#### NOTE
The theme is still in barebones and it has a minimal syntax highlight support.
Decent javascript syntax.
Decent golang syntax.

#### TODO
* A lot of lang syntax.
* lightline theme support.
* Better nerdtree support.
* [ ... ]
