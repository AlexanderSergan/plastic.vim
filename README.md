# candid.vim
A dark vim/neovim color scheme inspired in VSCode theme Plastic and Onedark

### Install

Copy `colors/candid.vim` in your `[vim/neovim]/colors` directory.

```vim
syntax on
colorscheme candid
```

#### NOTE
The theme is still in barebones and it has a minimal syntax highlight support.
