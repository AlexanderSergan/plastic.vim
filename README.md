# plastic.vim

A dark vim/neovim color scheme inspired in the awesome [VSCode Plastic](https://github.com/will-stone/plastic) theme.

### Install

Copy `colors/plastic.vim` in your `~/.vim/colors` or `~/.config/nvim/colors` directory.

```vim
set background=dark

syntax on
colorscheme plastic
```

#### NOTE

The theme has decent syntax highlight.
Removed the Light theme in order to create a separate project. Also renamed it to `Plastic.vim` in
honor to the original VS Code theme.

Added Lightline support.

If you want to customize it only need to install [lifepillar/vim-colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate) and edit the template files.

#### TODO

- Add A lot of more lang syntax support.
- ~~lightline theme support.~~
- Better nerdtree support.
- Improve color accessibility.
- ~~Improve html syntax.~~
- [ ... ]
