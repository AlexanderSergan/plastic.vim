# candid.vim
A dark vim/neovim color scheme inspired in the awesome [VSCode Plastic](https://github.com/will-stone/plastic) theme.

### Install

Copy `colors/candid.vim` in your `[vim/neovim]/colors` directory.

#### NOTE
The theme has decent syntax highlight. Only tested with Javascript and golang.

#### TODO
* Add A lot of more lang syntax support.
* lightline theme support.

* [ ... ]
